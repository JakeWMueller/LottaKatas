# LottaKatas
# Code Wars solutions, and wrong answers for that matter, in JavaScript and Python to up the heat map and show interviewers what Leetcode problems I've done because I'm playing life on Hard Mode. No peeking Coding Temple students! 
# I've placed each file into their respective kyu difficulty, along with links, though sometimes the site managers change the kyu.
# Links to problems on CodeWars can be found in the README's of each kyu difficulty
